# PixelPhysics

Our goal is to make a realtime physics simulation built around pixels, each pixel is one unit of a substance and there are different substances that behave differently and can interact with each other.

List of planned substances: Sand, Water, Stone, Metal, wet sand, fire, wood, plants, lava

We plan on using java.

In the future if that can be completed, it would be interesting to turn it into some sort of game.
