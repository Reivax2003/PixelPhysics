# PixelPhysics

Our goal is to make a realtime physics game built around pixels, each pixel is one unit of a substance and there are different substances that behave differently and can interact with each other. Some substances create other ones, like fire creates smoke, and some substances can combine into ones with different properties, like water + sand = wet sand.

List of substances:  
Acid
Ash
Charcoal
Duplicate
Electricity
Fire (burns flammables, produces smoke),
Fuse and Fuse Powder
Gasoline
Ghost
Ice
Lava (burns flammables and melts through stone/metal),
Metal (conducts electricity),  
Plants (Flower, Alien and Vine(?Name?)),
Sand (falls downwards or diagonally),
Slime
Smoke (rises),
Soil (acts like sand, but heavier),
Steam
Stone (does nothing),
Water (falls down, diagonally, or moves left/right),  
Wet sand (created with sand+water, can stack at a higher angle than sand),    
Wood (can burn),  



We plan on using java because most of the team knows it and it has a library for simple 2d rendering.
Other than that we aren't using any other libraries or dependencies.

The game has a campaign and a creative mode:  

In the campaign mode, there is a village of pixel people who have a list of needed resources. The player must use their energy to combine materials and satisfy the villagers' needs. The happier the villagers, the more energy and materials will be available to the player.  

In the creative mode, there are no limitations on energy or materials, and the gameplay will be closer to a sandbox style. This is great for trying out ideas for the campagin mode, or just playing and experimenting with combining materials or creating their own world.
