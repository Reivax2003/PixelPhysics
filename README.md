# PixelPhysics

Our goal is to make a realtime physics simulation built around pixels, each pixel is one unit of a substance and there are different substances that behave differently and can interact with each other. Some substances create other ones, like fire creates smoke, and some substances can combine into ones with different properties, like water + sand = wet sand.

List of substances:  
Acid
Ash
Charcoal
Electricity
Fire (burns flammables, produces smoke),
Fuse and Fuse Powder
Gasoline
Ghost
Ice
Lava (burns flammables and melts through stone/metal),
Metal (conducts electricity),  
Plants (Flower, Alien and Vine(?Name?)),
Sand (falls downwards or diagonally),
Slime
Smoke (rises),
Soil (acts like sand, but heavier),
Steam
Stone (does nothing),
Water (falls down, diagonally, or moves left/right),  
Wet sand (created with sand+water, can stack at a higher angle than sand),    
Wood (can burn),  



We plan on using java because most of the team knows it and it has a library for simple 2d rendering.
Other than that we aren't using any other libraries or dependencies.

The user experience should be similar to a sandbox combined with a chemistry lab, where the user can experiment with mixing different substances to see their interactions. Each substance is based off of simple rules, but they can be combined to produce complex behavior (like a rube goldberg machine).

In the future if that can be completed, it would be interesting to turn it into some sort of game.
