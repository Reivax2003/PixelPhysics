# PixelPhysics

Our goal is to make a realtime physics simulation built around pixels, each pixel is one unit of a substance and there are different substances that behave differently and can interact with each other.

List of planned substances:  
Sand (falls downwards or diagonally),
Soil (acts like sand, but heavier),
Water (falls down, diagonally, or moves left/right),  
Stone (does nothing),  
Metal (does nothing),  
wet sand (created with sand+water, can stack at a higher angle than sand),  
fire (burns flammables),  
wood (can burn),  
plants (grow on sand?),  
lava (burns flammables and melts through stone/metal),

We plan on using java.

In the future if that can be completed, it would be interesting to turn it into some sort of game.
