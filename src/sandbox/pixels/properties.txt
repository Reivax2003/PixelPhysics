Here is the list of all the currently used pixel properties
some might be better explainied by the person who made them

acidity         chance to dissolve another substance (0 to 100)
angle           plant2
conductive      chance to transmit electricity (0 to 100)
density         determines if it will sink in other substances
direction       plant2
fertile         whether plants can grow on it
flammable       can it catch on fire (0 to 1)
fluidity        how well it flows sideways (0 to 100)
fragile         
fuel            how long it can burn
gravity         how fast it falls
growing         plant's growing state (0 to 2)

speed           chance plant will grow (0 to 100)
split           plant2
spreads         does it spread (0 to 1)
steepness       how steep it can stack in a pile
strength        fire strength, also determines if it can spread
support         diagonal falling (0 to 1)
temperature     temperature of pixel (0 to 25: freezing, 25 to 75: normal, 75 to 100: melting)
turning         plant2
